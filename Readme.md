# KRIDOC - Diseased Crop review app
`SIH23 submission by CtrlCrew`

A single page web app that lets farmers upload photos of their sick crops which are then available to scientists to research and categorize 
> We plan to make it a PWA so it'll be installable  
  
**Necessary info to use the demo:**

* Farmer login : username - f1 , password - f1
* Scientist login : username - s1 , password - s1

It also will autoregister you if you put in a new username and password but then it'll remember that.

The demo is to mainly show the UI flow, Functions like uploading images and the rest of the buttons do not work yet.

*If you get a blank screen on the url please try refreshing with f5 a few times it's a vercel caching problem and probably shouldn't occur unless a new commit has just been pushed before your visit*

## To run locally

* Clone the repository
* `cd SIH23`
* `cd client`
* `npm install`
* `npm run autobuild`
* Run `app.py`

**Your app should start on `localhost:5000`**
