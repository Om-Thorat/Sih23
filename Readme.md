# KRIDOC - Diseased Crop review app
`SIH23 submission by CtrlCrew`

A single page web app that lets farmers upload photos of their sick crops which are then available to scientists to research and categorize 
> We plan to make it a PWA so it'll be installable  
  
**Necessary info to use the demo:**

* Farmer login : username - f1 , password - f1
* Scientist login : username - s1 , password - s1

*If you get a blank screen on the url please try refreshing with f5 a few times it's a vercel caching problem and probably shouldn't occur unless a new commit has just been pushed before your visit*

## To run locally

* Clone the repository
* `cd SIH23`
* `cd client`
* `npm install`
* `npm run autobuild`
* Run `app.py`

**Your app should start on `localhost:5000`**
